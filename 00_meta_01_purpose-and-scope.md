# Purpose and Scope

Shared AI development guidelines live here as a contract. The documents define workflow, standards, and conventions so AI assistants and developers operate consistently and safely across projects. Treat this folder as the source of truth for expectations on security, quality, git hygiene, testing, and context maintenance when working on participating codebases. When stack-specific guidance appears (e.g., Java/Spring examples), apply it where relevant and adapt or override locally when the stack differs.
